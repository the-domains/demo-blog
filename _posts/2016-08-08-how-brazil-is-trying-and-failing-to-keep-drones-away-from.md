  On Friday, more than 60,000 people packed into Rio's Macarenã stadium for the
  opening ceremony of the 2016 Olympic Games - but above their heads, something

  hovering above the stadium, triggering a security panic that reached all the
  way to the teams providing protection for visiting heads of state.
