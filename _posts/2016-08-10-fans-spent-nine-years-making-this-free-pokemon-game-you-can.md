  Pokémon Uranium is a fan-version game based on the central roleplaying games
  of the franchise. Like the upcoming official Pokémon Sun and Moon, the game
  features a tropical setting. Unlike its contemporary, the game includes 150
  new and unofficial pokémon - a good choice, as it avoids outright copyright
  infringement of characters like Pikachu and Bulbasaur.
